RECOMMENDED_FELLOW is a true asset for any positions requiring RELEVANT_SKILL and has my warmest recommendation.",

    "RECOMMENDED_FELLOW is a fountain of ideas! Incredibly proactive in coming up with experiments to test out and pitch to our team.

Working with RECOMMENDED_FELLOW is going to be one of my fondest memories from my time at the MLH Fellowship."
